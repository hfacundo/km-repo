# Summary

Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design pattern where applications communicate with each other by producing and consuming events. Events are data packets that encapsulate information about something that has happened. Applications that produce events are called publishers, while applications that consume events are called subscribers.

## Key advantages of event-driven architecture:

 * Decoupling: Event-driven architecture decouples applications from each other, meaning that they do not need to know each other's internal details in order to communicate. This makes it easier to develop and maintain applications, and it also makes it easier to scale applications independently.

 * Asynchronous communication: Event-driven architecture enables asynchronous communication between applications. This means that publishers do not need to wait for subscribers to process events before they can continue. This can improve the performance of applications, and it can also make applications more resilient to failures.

 * Loose coupling: Event-driven architecture promotes loose coupling between applications. This means that applications are not tightly coupled to each other, and they can be easily changed or replaced without affecting other applications.

 * Scalability: Event-driven architecture is highly scalable. This means that applications can be easily scaled to handle increasing workloads by adding more publishers and subscribers.

 * Flexibility: Event-driven architecture is very flexible. This means that it can be used to implement a wide variety of applications, from simple web applications to complex enterprise systems.


## When should we use it?

Examples of when Event Driven Architecture is a good choice:

 * Real-time data processing: EDA is ideal for applications that need to process data in real time, such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, and live dashboards.

 * Microservices architecture: EDA is a key component of microservices architecture, as it allows microservices to communicate with each other without tightly coupling them.

 * Eventual consistency: EDA is well-suited for applications that need eventual consistency, which means that data may not be immediately available to all subscribers.

 * Highly distributed systems: EDA is a good choice for highly distributed systems, as it can handle a large number of publishers and subscribers.

Overall, EDA is a powerful and versatile architecture that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. If you are looking for an architecture that is decoupled, scalable, and flexible, then EDA is a good option to consider.

Examples

```
// Publisher
public class OrderPlacedEvent {
    private final String orderId;
    private final String customerId;
    private final List<Product> products;

    public OrderPlacedEvent(String orderId, String customerId, List<Product> products) {
        this.orderId = orderId;
        this.customerId = customerId;
        this.products = products;
    }

    public String getOrderId() {
        return orderId;
    }

    public String getCustomerId() {
        return customerId;
    }

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return products;
    }
}

// Subscriber
public class OrderProcessingService {
    public void handleOrderPlacedEvent(OrderPlacedEvent event) {
        // Process the order
        System.out.println("Processing order " + event.getOrderId());

        // Send an email to the customer
        System.out.println("Sending email to customer " + event.getCustomerId());

        // Update the inventory
        for (Product product : event.getProducts()) {
            System.out.println("Updating inventory for product " + product.getName());
        }
    }
}

```

In this example, the OrderPlacedEvent class represents an event that is published when an order is placed. The OrderProcessingService class is a subscriber that consumes OrderPlacedEvent events. When an OrderPlacedEvent event is published, the OrderProcessingService class processes the order, sends an email to the customer, and updates the inventory.

## Use cases

 * Event-driven architecture (EDA) has gained widespread adoption among leading technology companies due to its ability to handle real-time data, promote loose coupling, and support distributed systems. Here are some notable examples of companies that leverage EDA in their operations:

 * Netflix: Netflix employs EDA for its recommendation system, which analyzes user behavior and preferences to provide personalized content suggestions. EDA enables real-time data streaming and processing, ensuring that recommendations are updated based on the latest user interactions.

 * Uber: Uber utilizes EDA for its ride-sharing platform, managing the vast amount of data generated from driver locations, passenger requests, and trip details. EDA facilitates real-time ride matching, routing optimization, and surge pricing adjustments.

 * Amazon: Amazon relies on EDA for its e-commerce platform, handling the high volume of data from product listings, customer orders, and inventory management. EDA enables real-time order processing, inventory updates, and personalized product recommendations.

 * PayPal: PayPal employs EDA for its payment processing system, managing the flow of financial transactions, fraud detection, and risk management. EDA enables real-time transaction authorization, fraud detection algorithms, and risk assessment.

 * LinkedIn: LinkedIn utilizes EDA for its social media platform, managing the vast amount of data generated from user interactions, connections, and professional activities. EDA enables real-time updates to news feeds, personalized recommendations, and targeted advertising.

 * Spotify: Spotify employs EDA for its music streaming service, managing the high volume of data from music playback, user preferences, and recommendation algorithms. EDA enables real-time personalization of music recommendations, seamless playback transitions, and adaptive bitrate streaming.
